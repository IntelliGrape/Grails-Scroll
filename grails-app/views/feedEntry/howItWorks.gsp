    <h3>Lazy Loading</h3>

    We generally have large amount of data to show but we cannot load all at once as it may take too much time. In order to improve performance of web page, we can load data

    from server while scrolling down the web page using ajax. It would increase atleast initial loading of page and rest of the loading will take place as user will scroll

    down to web page. When we reach at the end of web page, the code recognizes that we are at the bottom of web page and requests for more data using ajax.<br/><br/><br/>

    <h3>What is Lazy Loading?</h3>

    The ability to load content gradually as visitors scroll down to web page, more content is being loaded dynamically without a page refresh.<br/><br/><br/>

    <h3>Benefits of Using Lazy Loading Technique</h3>

    If there is large amount of data that user needs to show, then loading all data at once would degrade performance of initial loading of page.<br/><br/><br/>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    Instead of using pagination on a page we can use this technique to show more data because it does not interrupt user's flow of viewing data.

    This technique fits best for browsing information.<br/><br/><br/>
